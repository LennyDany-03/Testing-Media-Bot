❓ Ask a stock market question: What are the latest developments in tech stocks?

🤖 Based on the latest news, tech stocks have shown mixed performance. 
   Apple shares rose 2.3% following their AI announcement at WWDC. 
   Meanwhile, Nvidia continues its upward trend, gaining 1.7% today 
   as demand for AI chips remains strong. However, smaller tech companies

❓ Ask a stock market question: How are global markets reacting to the latest Fed decision?

🤖 Global markets have responded cautiously to the Federal Reserve's decision 
   to maintain current interest rates. Asian markets showed modest gains with 
   the Nikkei up 0.8% and Shanghai Composite rising 0.3%. European markets 
   were mixed, with the FTSE 100 down 0.2% while the DAX gained 0.4%. 
   
   Analysts note that while the pause in rate hikes was expected, the Fed's 
   projection of potential future increases later this year has created some 
   uncertainty in global markets.
